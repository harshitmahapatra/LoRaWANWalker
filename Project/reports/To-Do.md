# IoT To-Do


- If its not moving only send data sporadically
- Add timestamp and nodeID to each data point
- Store with (timestamp+nodeID) as primary key

# Tests
## Energy
- Leave it overnight

## Consistency
Compare the data we get by using it for 30 minutes

## Accuracy
Pressure we tested (completely accurate)
HR - Use max's 
Movement - Get 10 measurements and see percentage it got right
GPS - Go outdoors and get 10 measurements. Compare with phone

## Serviceability
- Have Max disconnect some cables and Patrick reconnect. Measure time
- Time for replacing battery


# MEGA EXPERIMENT (30 minutes)

- monitor energy with usb thingy
- use all the sensors (consistency)
- use max's watch
