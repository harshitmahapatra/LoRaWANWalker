## Accuracy
### Pressure Sensors
We measured the pressure 5 times with a 1kg bag of rice and always got a measurement of exactly 1.00.

### Accelerometer

### GPS

### Heart Rate

## Modularity
To test modularity, we added the GPS sensor only in the testing phase. 
Took 2 days
Challenges:
- Hard to find a port that was not somehow taken up by other sensor.
- Library support is crude and hard to integrate, so after unsuccessfully trying to use external libraries, we ended up implementing it ourselves, which took some extra time.
