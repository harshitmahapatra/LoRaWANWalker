We wanted to help and approached the Alexandra Instituttet, asking if they had any IoT projects that could also involve bioinformatics and machine learning. Morten Kyng, head of Health IT Lab, already had in mind the idea of building a walker which could track itâ€™s users heath parameters, so a doctor could inspect these. The projects objective is the long term monitoring of elderly people using walkers.
