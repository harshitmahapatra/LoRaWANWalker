    We would first like to thank the Head of Health IT Lab at the Alexandira Institute Morten Kyng and our Professor Niels Olof Bouvin who is a member of the Participatory Information Technology department at the Aarhus University. Both gentlemen made this project in several ways possible.\\
    \bigskip
    \bigskip
    \bigskip
    The door to Professor Olof's and Professor Doctor Morten Kyng's office was always open whenever we ran into a trouble spot or had a question about our research or writing. They consistently gave us different perspectives to a given problem and helped in creating this final report which states the finale results of our research.\\
    \bigskip
    \bigskip
    \bigskip
    We would also like to thank the experts that we have consulted during our way. Namely the Orbit Lab and ChomskyLab. Without their passionate participation and input, the project including the combination of the used elements could not have been that successfully.\\
