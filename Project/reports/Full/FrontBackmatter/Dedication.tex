    We would first like to thank the Head of Health IT Lab at the Alexandra Instituttet Morten Kyng and our Professor Niels Olof Bouvin who is a member of the Participatory Information Technology department at the Aarhus University. Both gentlemen made this project in several ways possible.\\
    \bigskip
    \bigskip
    \bigskip
    The door to Professor Olof's and Professor Doctor Morten Kyng's office was always open whenever we had problems or a question about our research or writing. They consistently gave us different perspectives and helped in creating this final report which states the final results of our research.\\\\

    \bigskip
    \bigskip
    We would also like to thank the experts that we have consulted alont the way, namely Orbit Lab and ChomskyLab. Without their passionate participation and input, we would not have had the resources to make the project as successful.\\
