\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

The above opening passage from 'A Tale of Two  Cities ' by Charles Dickens would describe excellently the highs and lows in this project. In the following we want to acknowledge people who mattered during this time.\\

First and for most, we would like to thank the Head of Health IT Lab at the Alexandra Institute Morten Kyng and our Professor Niels Olof Bouvin who is a member of the Participatory Information Technology department at the Aarhus University. Both gentlemen made this project in several ways possible. Without there constant support and able guidance, this project would not have been complete.\\

The door to Professor Olof's and Professor Doctor Morten Kyng's office was always open whenever we had troubles or a question about our research or writing. They consistently gave us different perspectives on each problem and helped in creating this final report which states the final results of our research.\\

We would also like to thank the experts that we have consulted along the way, namely Orbit Lab and ChomskyLab. 
Without their passionate participation and input regarding hardware, the project could not have been that successful.
