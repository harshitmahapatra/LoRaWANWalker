Nowadays Healthcare is a field of growing interest for data collection, as the remote monitoring of patients not only allows us to reduce our response time for emergencies but also gives us valuable insights into their health, which in turn leads to better diagnosis regarding disabilities or diseases.\\

In this project we want to build a proof of concept that realizes the above ideas. We will introduce our approach and explain how we managed to get data out of a walker user, building the foundation for analyzing it in the future.
